<h1>St John's Church Management System Project<br />Use Cases</h1>

<h2>Families and Persons</h2>

<h3><a name="add-family">Add Family</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Merina has received a communication card in the "7pm" box from a couple whose names she does not recognise</li>
<li>She searches for their name (see <a href="#search-for-name">Search For Name</a>) and finds no matches, so she knows this is a new Family</li>
<li>Merina clicks on the "add family" link in the main navigation, and the system shows her the "add family" form</li>
<li>Merina fills in the family name and any supplied data relevant to the family as a whole (home tel, postal address etc)</li>
<li>Merina fills in the details of the Persons who will be members of this family, including their names and the congregation they attended (7pm).  The 'surname' field for each Person is pre-poplated with the family name but she can change it if necessary</li>
<li>Merina enters an initial note for the family (this field is compulsory), indicating that they filled in a communication card and what boxes they ticked</li>
<li>Merina clicks the 'submit' button.  The system creates the Family record, the two Person records and a Family Note record.  For each of these, the user who created them and the date on which they were created is recorded.  The status of the Family Note is set to 'awaiting action' and its subject is set to 'New Family'.  (NB If the family contained only one member, the note would be created as a person note because of the business rule that says family notes can only be added to familys with more than one member)</li>
</ol>


<h3><a name="search-for-name">Search For Name</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Andrew has met someone on Sunday whose first name was Robert but whose last name he doesn't remember.  Robert told him that he'd come to church a couple of times before and had filled in a card.</li>
<li>Andrew enters the name 'Robert' into the 'name search' box on the home page and clicks the 'search' button</li>
<li>The system lists all the familys with family names like 'Robert' and all the Persons with first name or surname like 'Robert'.  Next to each entry there are links to perform various actions on each Family / Person (eg <a href="#view-family-record">View Family Record</a>, <a href="#edit-person-record">Edit Person Record</a>, <a href="#add-family-note">Add Family Note</a>).</li>
<li>Andrew quickly scans the short list and the only entry he doesn't recognise is 'Robert Jones'.  He concludes that it was Robert Jones he spoke to on Sunday.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="view-family-record">View Family Record</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Merina needs to post a roster to Sarah Smith, who does not have email</li>
<li>Merina searches for the name 'Sarah Smith' (see <a href="#search-for-name">Search For Name</a>)</li>
<li>Merina clicks the 'View Family Record' link next to the relevant entry in the search result list</li>
<li>The system displays the Family Record for the family that Sarah Smith belongs to, including the postal address, family notes and person notes for all the members of the family</li>
<li>Merina sees the address and uses it as required</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="edit-family-record">Edit Family Record</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Merina has receieved a communication card from the Barrett family indicating that they have moved house</li>
<li>She searches for 'Barrett' (see <a href="#search-for-name">Search For Name</a>) and clicks the 'Edit Family Record' link next to their entry in the search results</li>
<li>The system acquires the lock on the Barrett Family record for Merina.  This means that nobody else can edit this family record until she's finished.  (Alternate path:  somebody else already has the lock on the Barrett Family record and the system asks Merina to wait til they are finished)</li>
<li>The system shows Merina the 'Edit Family' form, with the current values of the family fields filled in</li>
<li>Merina replaces the values of the 'street address', 'suburb' and 'postcode' fields with the new address and clicks the 'Save' button</li>
<li>The system saves the new values in the Barrett Family record, logs the event of Merina making these changes to the Barrett Family record, and releases the lock</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="view-person-record">View Person Record</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Andrew wants to talk to Joe about Joe's ideas for repainting the sanctuary, that they were talking about on Sunday</li>
<li>Andrew searches for the name 'Joe' (see <a href="#search-for-name">Search For Name</a>) and clicks the 'View Person Record' link next to the relevant entry in the search results list</li>
<li>The system shows all the details for Joe, including details from his Family record, all his person notes and all his Family Notes.</li>
<li>Andrew notices that the 'contact notes' field indicates Joe is only contactable on his mobile during business hours, so he dials the number shown in the 'mobile number' field.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="edit-person-record">Edit Person Record</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>While Andrew is talking to Joe about what colour they should paint the communion table (see <a href="#view-person-record">View Person Record</a>), Joe mentions that he can email through some images of his past work.  Andrew sees that there is currently no email address in Joe's person record</li>
<li>From the screen showing Joe's Person Record, Andrew clicks the 'Edit this Person' link</li>
<li>The system acquires the lock on Joe's Person record for Andrew.  This means that nobody else can edit this family record until she's finished.  (Alternate path:  somebody else already has the lock on the record and the system asks Andrew to wait til they are finished)</li>
<li>The system shows Andrew the "Edit Person" form</li>
<li>Andrew enters the email address Joe has just dictated to him into the 'email address' field and clicks 'Save'</li>
<li>The system updates Joe's Person Record, logs the event of Andrew making these changes to the Joe's Person record,  and releases the lock on it</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="move-person-to-other-family">Move Person to a different family</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Alison Smith has just got married to Stuart Jones.  They both exist in the system as separate one-member familys.  Merina wants to record the marriage in the system.</li>
<li>Merina opens the Jones family record and notes that the family ID is 678.</li>
<li>Merina opens the Alison Smith's person record and clicks the "move this person to another family" link</li>
<li>The system acquires the lock on Alison's Person Record and shows Merina the "move person to different family" form.</li>
<li>Merina enters the Jones family ID (678) into the "destination family ID" box and clicks "Move"</li>
<li>The system adds Alison as a member of the Jones family.</li>
<li>Because there are no members left in the Smith family record, this record removed.  If any family notes are present, they are attached to the Jones family instead and their subjects are prefixed with "[Added to Smith family]".  </li>
<li>Note: The manual copying of Family ID is used here to save development time on an infrequently performed task</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="move-person-to-new-family">Move Person to a New family</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Johan Carr has just moved out of home and is no longer living with his parents.  He has submitted a communication card indicating this and his new address</li>
<li>Upon receiving the card, Merina opens Johan's person record and clicks the "create a new family for this person" link. She clicks "yes, I'm sure".</li>
<li>The system creates a new family record with the same core details as Johan's current family.  It links Johan to this new family and unlinks him from the old one.  The system shows Merina the "edit family" form for the new family it has just created.</li>
<li>Merina changes the values of the relevant fields, removing the value of the home tel field since Johan doesn't have a landline in his new home.  She clicks 'save'</li>
<li>The system saves the details of Johan's new family record.  When listing all familys, two "Carr" entries appear, one with Johan's first name only and one with his parents' names only.
